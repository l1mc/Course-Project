# Machine Learning for Business: Course Project
* This repositpries hosts the code that I wrote in Machine Learning for Business (MLB) Class.
* In MLB class, I learned the basic concepts, principles and methods of machine learning.
* Also, I learned how to use R language.

## Introduction
* In this course, I mainly played with 5 data set:  Wine Quality, a data set made up by the professor, Click-Through Rate, Letter Recognition, and Stock Return. 

## 1. Wine Quality
* The data set is from the [UCI Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).
* With this data set, I practiced using [Linear Regression](https://github.com/l1mc/Machine-Learning-for-Business-CourseProject/blob/master/Predict%20Wine%20Quality%20with%20LR.R) to fit and predict. 
* Also, the data set helped me practiced how to use the [kNN model and Logistic model](https://github.com/l1mc/Machine-Learning-for-Business-CourseProject/blob/master/Wine%20Quality%20with%20kNN%20and%20Logit.R).  

## 2. A data set made up by the professor
* This data set was made by the professor using a function with X and the power of X as arguments.
* I added the powers of X into my model gradually to observe the change of bias and variance.
* I did [Bias-Variance trade-off](https://github.com/l1mc/Machine-Learning-for-Business-CourseProject/blob/master/Bias-Variance%20Trade-off.R) with this data set.  

## 3. Click-Through Rate
* This data set collect the data of the lick-through rate of an advertising demand-side platform. 
* I used this data set to practice how to use [Regularization](https://github.com/l1mc/Machine-Learning-for-Business-CourseProject/blob/master/Predict%20the%20Click-through.R).  

## 4. Letter Recognition
* This data set provides statistics of images of four letters â€“ A, B, P, and R. 
* My task is to predict which letter a particular image corresponds to. 
* I practiced using [XGBoost model](https://github.com/l1mc/Machine-Learning-for-Business-CourseProject/blob/master/Letter%20Recognition%20with%20XGB%20.R) with this data set.  

## 5. Stock Return
* This data set contains monthly stock returns (from January to November) from the NASDAQ stock exchange.
* My task is to predict the stock return in December.
* I [clusterd the data set](https://github.com/l1mc/Machine-Learning-for-Business-CourseProject/blob/master/Predict%20Stock%20Returns%20after%20Clustering.R) and use the clustering results to make some predictions about future stock returns.
